# Global Objects

* Global objects helps in understanding where the transaction comes from and what happened in inside
* Three very important global properties
* * `msg.sender # The address of Account to initialise the transactions`
  * `msg.value # How much ether was sent along?`
  * `now` (The current Time stamp)
    * This can be influenced to a certain level of miners
    * Don't use it for odd/ even numbers
