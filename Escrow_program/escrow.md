# Escrow contract with time limitation 

This can also be used to escrow Ether into a Smart Contract.
First we'll do a very simple deposit/withdrawal example,
then I'll show you how a Smart Contract can lock funds using a time-activated withdrawal functionality.In this lab you are going learn how a Smart Contract manages its own funds.

You will send Ether to your Smart Contract. Then the Smart Contract will manage its own Ether and will be able to relay it to anyone else.
It's like a bank account with programming code attached to it.
